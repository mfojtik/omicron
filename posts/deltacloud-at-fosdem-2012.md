<a href="http://deltacloud.org" target="_blank">Deltacloud API<></a> was
presented at <a href="http://fosdem.org" target="_blank">FOSDEM 2012</a> in
Brussels.  As I promised to some people on the conference, I published an <a
href="http://omicron.mifo.sk/dc"  target="_blank">online version</a> of my talk.
I was asked some interesting questions about extending the API to support more
features like Amazon RDS or how OpenStack compete with Deltacloud API. Both are
worth more discussion, so if anyone is interested in starting this thread in
Deltacloud API <a
href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/deltacloud-dev/">mailing
list</a>, feel fres to do so. Also, thank you all who attended my talk and the
conference and I would really appreciate any form of feedback :-) I love the
informal atmosphere and the opportunity to meet with many people I usually speak
only through IRC.
